# COBOL Programming Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a series of COBOL programming exercises designed to develop and demonstrate proficiency in COBOL. The exercises range from beginner to advanced levels, covering a variety of fundamental and advanced COBOL concepts.

## Structure

The repository is structured into three main categories:
- **Easy**: Basic COBOL exercises to get started.
- **Intermediate**: Exercises that introduce more complex concepts and logic.
- **Advanced**: Challenging exercises that involve file handling, data processing, and larger projects.

## Getting Started

To run the COBOL programs in this repository, you will need a COBOL compiler. We recommend using GnuCOBOL (https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) for its ease of use and active community support.

## Installation

#### On Linux
Install GnuCOBOL using the package manager:
```bash
sudo apt-get install open-cobol
```
#### On Windows
Download and install from GnuCOBOL's official site.

## Compiling and Running Programs
Navigate to the directory containing the COBOL program and compile it using:
```bash
cobc -x program-name.cob -o program-name
```
Run the compiled program:
```bash
./program-name
```
